## Modern KeyBinding

### The mod ported the newer version's KeyModifier && KeyConflictContext back to Fabric & Early Forge.
### Features

You can now define a keybinding's activation key with key modifiers. Like "Ctrl + G" or "Alt + S";

The keybindings with the same activation key but different key conflict contexts no longer conflict.

"Non-conflict keys" (disabled by default): The keybindings with the same key will all be activated if the key is pressed.
